# Programming In Haskell, 2nd Edition

This repository contains my solutions to Graham Hutton's Programming in Haskell (2nd Edition) book.

### **The solutions**

* Chapter 4: [Defining functions](Chapter4/chapter4.md)
* Chapter 5: [List comprehensions](Chapter5/chapter5.md)
* Chapter 6: [Recursive functions](Chapter6/chapter6.md)
* Chapter 7: [High-order functions](Chapter7/chapter7.md)
* Chapter 8: [Declaring types and classes](Chapter8/chapter8.md)
* Chapter 12: [Monads and more](Chapter12/chapter12.md)
* Chapter 14: [Foldables and friends](Chapter14/chapter14.md)
* Chapter 15: [Lazy evaluation](Chapter15/chapter15.md)

**NOTES**:
* Solutions were checked manually in ghci, but not via property based testing
* Some exercises might me missing in some chapters
* I included only the exercises that could be implemented. There are some other helpful exercises in the book which require just writing stuff down on a paper
* I am using this repository to document my intro to Haskell programming, therefore it is entirely possible that I did not adhere to some Haskell programming conventions
